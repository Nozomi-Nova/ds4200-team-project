            <p>
                Corporate credit ratings play a crucial role in financial markets, influencing investment decisions, borrowing
                costs, and overall economic stability.
                Issued by agencies such as Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch, these ratings assess a company’s
                creditworthiness based on financial performance, debt levels,
                and other key factors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Investors, lenders, and policymakers rely on credit ratings to evaluate the financial health of companies. A
                high credit rating (e.g., AAA, AA) indicates strong
                financial stability and lower risk, while lower ratings (e.g., BB, B, CCC) suggest higher default risk.
                Understanding what drives these ratings helps businesses
                optimize their financial strategies and aids investors in making informed decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our project analyzes corporate credit ratings across different industries, identifying key financial ratios that
                impact ratings and evaluating predictive models
                for rating classification. Through data visualization and machine learning, we provide insights into financial
                indicators that influence creditworthiness.

            <h2 class="text-center">Data Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project is based on a dataset containing <strong>678 corporate credit ratings</strong> from <strong>2010 to
                    2016</strong>, sourced from
                <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kirtandelwadia/corporate-credit-rating-with-financial-ratios?resource=download"
                    target="_blank">Kaggle</a>.
                The dataset includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Company details:</strong> Name, industry sector, and assigned credit rating.</li>
                <li><strong>Rating agency information:</strong> Ratings from Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, or Fitch.</li>
                <li><strong>Financial ratios:</strong> Debt/Equity Ratio, Current Ratio, EBIT Margin, Operating Margin, Return
                    on Assets (ROA), and others.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3 class="mt-4">Key Financial Ratios Analyzed</h3>
            <p>
                To better understand credit ratings, we focus on the following financial ratios, normalized using
                <strong>Z-scores</strong> to enable comparisons across different sectors:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Debt/Equity Ratio:</strong> Measures financial leverage. Higher values indicate greater reliance on
                    debt.</li>
                <li><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> Assesses liquidity by comparing current assets to liabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>EBIT Margin:</strong> Evaluates operational profitability before interest and taxes.</li>
                <li><strong>Operating Margin:</strong> Indicates overall efficiency in converting revenue into profit.</li>
                <li><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> Measures how effectively a company utilizes assets to generate
                    profit.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                By analyzing these metrics, we aim to uncover which financial factors most influence corporate credit ratings
                and how they vary across industries.

                This visualization tracks the binary credit ratings of different industries over time. A binary rating of 1
                represents
                investment-grade ratings (BBB- and above), while a rating of 0 represents non-investment grade (BB+ and
                below). By
                analyzing the trends across sectors, we can observe how industries experience shifts in creditworthiness due to
                macroeconomic factors, industry-specific risks, and financial performance.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Key Trends and Real-World Context</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Financials (Purple Line):</strong> The sharp drop in credit ratings around 2010-2011 reflects
                    the
                    aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, where banks and financial institutions faced declining
                    creditworthiness
                    due to exposure to subprime mortgage losses. Over time, financial institutions stabilized as regulatory
                    reforms
                    (e.g., Dodd-Frank Act) helped rebuild investor confidence.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Energy (Red Line):</strong> The gradual decline after 2014 corresponds with the oil price
                    crash of 2014-2016,
                    where crude oil prices fell drastically due to oversupply and reduced global demand. Many oil and gas
                    companies faced
                    downgrades due to declining revenues and increased debt burdens.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Healthcare (Brown Line):</strong> The steady increase in ratings between 2010-2013 aligns with
                    the expansion
                    of healthcare policies such as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the United States. However, towards
                    2015-2016,
                    the sector experiences mild fluctuations, likely influenced by uncertainty surrounding policy changes and
                    pharmaceutical pricing regulations.

        <p class="text-center">
            Corporate credit ratings are heavily influenced by a company’s financial health, but the importance of specific
            financial
            metrics varies across industries. Some sectors rely more on leverage to drive growth, while others prioritize
            profitability
            and liquidity. This radar chart compares key financial ratios across different industries, providing insight
            into how financial
            characteristics shape creditworthiness.
        </p>
    
        <p class="text-center">
            To determine the most influential factors in corporate credit ratings, we analyzed a range of financial metrics
            using a logistic
            regression model. The model assigned weights (coefficients) to each financial ratio, measuring their impact on
            whether a firm
            received an investment-grade rating. We standardized all financial ratios using Z-score normalization to ensure
            comparability across
            sectors. The final selection of the top five financial factors was based on their absolute coefficient values,
            indicating the strongest
            predictors of credit ratings.
        </p>
    
        <p class="text-center">
            The most significant features identified were Debt/Equity Ratio, Current Ratio, EBIT Margin, Operating Margin,
            and Return on Assets (ROA).
            A high Debt/Equity Ratio suggests greater financial leverage, which can be riskier depending on a company’s
            ability to service debt.
            The Current Ratio reflects liquidity and a firm’s short-term financial stability. EBIT Margin and
            Operating Margin measure
            profitability before and after operational expenses, highlighting how efficiently a company generates earnings.
            Return on Assets (ROA)
            indicates how well a company utilizes its assets to generate profit, making it particularly relevant for
            asset-intensive industries.
        </p>
    
        <p class="text-center">
            The radar chart allows us to see how these financial metrics vary across industries. Financial firms tend to
            have high Debt/Equity Ratios,
            reflecting their reliance on leverage, while Retail and Telecommunications sectors have lower ROA due to high
            infrastructure costs.
            Business Equipment and Manufacturing industries show higher EBIT Margins, demonstrating stronger operational
            efficiency.
            Meanwhile, the Energy sector tends to have volatile Operating Margins, influenced by commodity price
            fluctuations.

        <p class="text-center">
            This visualization highlights how industries prioritize different financial strategies based on their operating
            environment.
            The results suggest that leverage, liquidity, and profitability are the strongest predictors of
            creditworthiness.
            A company with high debt and low liquidity is more likely to receive a lower rating, while firms with strong
            profit margins
            and asset efficiency tend to secure higher ratings. These insights provide a deeper understanding of financial
            decision-making

        <h2 class="text-center">Sector-Based Key Financial Ratios</h2>
    
        <p class="text-center text-muted">
            Financial ratios provide critical insights into a company's financial health, stability, and operational
            efficiency.
            Here, we analyze sector-based variations in liquidity, leverage, and profitability, highlighting how
            financial structure differs across industries.
        </p>
    
        <p class="text-center">
            We normalized financial ratios using Z-score standardization to ensure fair comparisons across sectors. Since financial
            metrics vary widely by industry—capital-intensive sectors like Utilities typically have higher debt levels, while Tech
            firms rely less on debt—raw values alone wouldn’t provide meaningful insights.
            
            Why Z-score? Unlike min-max scaling, which compresses data into a fixed range, Z-score preserves the distribution and
            outliers, making it ideal for financial analysis. It measures how many standard deviations a value deviates from its
            sector mean, allowing us to neutralize industry-specific biases while retaining important variations.
            
            What this enables: This transformation highlights companies that significantly deviate from sector norms, helping us
            identify financial outliers and trends more effectively. It also ensures our machine learning model generalizes better,
            preventing any single sector from disproportionately influencing feature importance calculations.

        <!-- Detailed Analysis -->
        <div class="mt-4">
            <h4>Data & Model Overview</h4>
            <p>
                To understand the key drivers behind corporate credit ratings, we trained a Logistic Regression model
                using a dataset containing financial ratios across multiple industries. Our target variable was a binary
                classification
                of credit ratings (0 = non-investment grade, 1 = investment grade). The features included key
                profitability, liquidity,
                and leverage ratios—many of which we explored earlier in our sector-based violin plots and radar chart.
            </p>
            <p>
                Logistic regression was chosen because it allows us to quantify the influence of each financial metric
                through its coefficients,
                making the results highly interpretable. A positive coefficient means the feature increases the
                likelihood of an investment-grade rating,
                while a negative coefficient suggests a higher risk of downgrade.
            </p>
    
            <h4>Key Findings</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Profitability metrics matter most:</strong> EBIT Margin (1.789), Gross Margin (0.443), and
                    Return on Assets (0.423)
                    had the strongest positive impact, reinforcing that companies with higher earnings and operational
                    efficiency tend to secure better ratings.</li>
                <li><strong>Leverage ratios influence risk:</strong> The Debt/Equity Ratio (-0.179) and Current Ratio
                    (-0.450) negatively correlated with
                    investment-grade ratings, confirming that excessive debt burdens and liquidity constraints can signal
                    financial instability.</li>
                <li><strong>Operational efficiency is a double-edged sword:</strong> While high operating performance is
                    usually favorable,
                    Operating Margin (-1.187) and EBITDA Margin (-0.825) showed a negative impact. This suggests that in
                    some cases, companies
                    prioritizing aggressive cost-cutting may do so at the expense of long-term stability.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h4>Connecting the Dots</h4>
            <p>
                Earlier, our violin plots revealed sector-based differences in financial ratios, and our radar chart showed
                how these features vary across industries. Now, by examining feature importance, we can pinpoint which
                financial metrics
                play the most decisive role across all sectors. This analysis confirms that profitability is a stronger
                indicator of creditworthiness
                than leverage alone, reinforcing the importance of earnings consistency in financial stability.
            </p>
    
            <h4>Why This Matters</h4>
            <p>
                Investors and analysts rely on credit ratings to assess financial risk. By understanding which financial
                metrics carry the most weight,
                stakeholders can make more informed decisions about corporate stability. The findings suggest that while
                debt levels are important,
                profitability and efficient asset utilization are more predictive of a strong credit rating.

        <!-- Brief Explanation -->
        <p class="text-center text-muted">
            After analyzing the key financial features driving credit ratings, we now assess how well our model performs
            across different sectors.
            This visualization compares accuracy (blue), F1-score (orange), precision (red), and recall (turquoise) for

        <!-- Detailed Analysis -->
        <div class="mt-4">
            <h4>Understanding the Metrics</h4>
            <p>
                Each sector's credit rating predictions are evaluated using multiple performance metrics:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accuracy (blue):</strong> Measures overall correctness but may not reflect class imbalances.
                </li>
                <li><strong>F1-score (orange):</strong> Balances precision and recall, useful for uneven class
                    distributions.</li>
                <li><strong>Precision (red):</strong> Indicates how many predicted investment-grade ratings were actually
                    correct.</li>
                <li><strong>Recall (turquoise):</strong> Measures how well the model identifies all actual investment-grade
                    firms.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h4>Key Observations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Utilities and Non-Durable Goods</strong> show strong recall but lower precision, meaning the
                    model captures most investment-grade firms but also misclassifies more.</li>
                <li><strong>Financials and Durable Goods</strong> have lower recall, suggesting the model struggles to
                    detect all investment-grade firms in these sectors.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy and Healthcare</strong> sectors display a balanced F1-score, indicating a good trade-off
                    between precision and recall.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h4>Connecting to Feature Importance</h4>
            <p>
                These performance results align closely with our feature importance findings, reinforcing how different
                financial metrics
                influence credit ratings across industries. The strong performance in sectors like Energy and Healthcare, where
                EBIT Margin
                and ROA were significant predictors, suggests that profitability plays a key role in rating assessments.
                Conversely, weaker recall
                in Financials and Durable Goods may indicate that credit ratings in these sectors depend more on balance sheet
                strength—factors
                like Debt/Equity Ratio and Current Ratio, which had lower coefficients in our model.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, sectors such as Utilities and Non-Durable Goods, which show high recall but lower precision,
                suggest that while
                the model is effective at identifying investment-grade firms, it may misclassify riskier firms due to overlapping
                financial characteristics.
                This aligns with our radar chart findings, where these sectors had similar distributions in key financial
                ratios, making classification
                more challenging.
            </p>
            <p>
                These insights highlight potential refinements—sector-specific weighting adjustments or additional financial
                indicators—to
                better capture industry-specific rating dynamics. Further fine-tuning could enhance the model’s predictive power,
                particularly for
                sectors where liquidity and leverage factors are more influential than profitability metrics.
            </p>
    
            <h4>Why This Matters</h4>
            <p>
                Understanding where the model performs well and where adjustments are needed helps in fine-tuning
                financial risk assessments.
                High recall is beneficial for risk-averse investors, while high precision is crucial for strict
                investment-grade classifications.
                These insights can guide future improvements, such as sector-specific model adjustments or incorporating
                additional financial indicators.

        <h2 class="text-center">Summary & Future Work</h2>
    
        <p>
            This project explores corporate credit ratings by analyzing key financial ratios, sector-based trends, and
            feature importance in predicting ratings. Through a combination of visualizations and model-driven analysis, we
            identified key financial indicators that influence credit ratings and examined how they vary across industries.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Our analysis revealed that financial health metrics like EBIT Margin, ROA, and Gross Margin are strong positive
            indicators of a company’s credit rating, while high Operating Margin and Debt/Equity Ratio tend to have a
            negative impact. Sector-based trends showed varying rating patterns, with financials being more sensitive to
            economic downturns, energy showing volatility, and healthcare maintaining relative stability. Additionally, our
            logistic regression model confirmed that profitability metrics hold the most predictive power.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Despite these insights, our analysis is limited by the dataset’s time range and the exclusion of qualitative
            factors such as market sentiment or macroeconomic conditions. Future work could incorporate time-series
            analysis to track rating trends over time, explore alternative modeling techniques to improve predictive
            accuracy, and integrate external economic indicators for a more comprehensive assessment.
